The main script vantagePointForest_Segmentation.m requires the following input (all scans should have similar voxel-spacings):
- scansTrain    (cell array of 3D volumes of grayvalue training scans)
- segmentsTrain (cell array of 3D volumes of same size with GT segmentations of scans)
- masksTrain    (cell array of 3D volumes of masks - region of interest)

- scanTest      (a 3D volume of test scan)
- maskTest      (region of interest for the above)

- output is a 3D volume segmentTest - the segmentation of the given scan
